# Travel-Planner-Agent
An AI agent for helping you in your trips.
Planning a trip can be time-consuming and confusing due to scattered information across multiple platforms. Users often struggle to choose destinations, create itineraries, manage bookings, and stay updated with real-time changes.

To solve this, we propose a Travel Planner Agent — an AI-powered assistant built using IBM Cloud Lite and IBM Granite. It helps users plan trips intelligently by: • Suggesting destinations based on preferences and budget • Generating personalized itineraries • Recommending transport and accommodations • Integrating real-time weather, maps, and alerts

This smart assistant simplifies complex travel planning into a seamless and interactive experience.
